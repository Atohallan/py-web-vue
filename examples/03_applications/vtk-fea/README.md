# VTK FEA

This example is a translation from a `dash-vtk` code described in that [blog](https://steve-kiefer.medium.com/3d-mesh-models-in-the-browser-using-python-dash-vtk-e15cbf36a132A) to a `py-web-vue` code base using native VTK.

The test data files can be found [here](https://github.com/shkiefer/dash_vtk_unstructured/tree/main/data).
